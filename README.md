# ELI5Notes
My programming notes - and thoughts available for people to read and comment. Figured it'd be alright to share my insanity. Who knows? Maybe this will help someone struggling with a subject.

Please keep in mind, I think i'm funny. *emphasis on the word: think* that being said, my notes are from different sources that i've gone and implemented into my own words. Throughout studying, i've found that often times the explanations for certain things can be pretty arcane. I've done my best to put them into my "own" words, so that I can get a better foundational understanding of the topic.

Let me finish with saying, i'm a vet, so, my humor might be a little bit farther into the sarcastic side. Take it as it is, and push forward.



*Not that anyone is going to read this anyway.*
